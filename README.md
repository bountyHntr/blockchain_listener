## Blockchain listener

This repository is for testing [modifications](https://github.com/bountyHntr/geth) in *Geth* node.

It contains a wrapper on the client for testing subscriptions to the node, as well as the test itself in `main.go`.

A custom subscription to full blocks has been added to the node.
